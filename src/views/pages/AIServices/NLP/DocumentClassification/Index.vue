      'As Pope Benedict sat down with the German journalist Peter Seewald at the papacy\'s summer residence a few months ago, he probably never imagined that his cautious remarks on condoms would spark international excitement. He appears to be constantly surprised that his ruminations should be noticed.Benedict reiterated the Catholic church\'s longstanding and dogmatic opposition to artificial birth control, which remains a grave sin â€“ though honoured rather more in the breach than the observance by many of the faithful, certainly in the western world. And, as some Catholic theologians and even several cardinals â€“ including the former archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O\'Connor â€“ have argued in recent years, using a condom to prevent a greater evil, the passing on of a lethal virus, may be licit.But it is the implication of his statement â€“ and the fact that the pope has made it himself â€“ that changes things.   In certain cases, where the intention is to reduce the risk of infection, [condom use] can nevertheless be a first step on the way to another, more humane, sexuality,   he said, adding:   There may be justified individual cases, for example when a male prostitute uses a condom.  For more than 40 years the church hierarchy has tied itself up in rhetorical knots to justify the encyclical Humanae Vitae of 1968, in which Pope Paul VI overturned the advice of his own papal commission to restate the church\'s opposition to any artificial birth control.Now, suddenly and maybe grudgingly, Benedict has acknowledged the weight of pragmatic advice and implicitly accepted the medical case that condoms do indeed help to prevent the spread of infection. He even seems to recognise, by the term male prostitute, that people who in his terms should not be having sex at all do so, and therefore need protection, especially if ultimately it helps them see the light.Welcome â€“ marginally â€“ to the real world. Cardinal Alfonso LÃ³pez Trujillo, who claimed in 2003 that the Aids virus could percolate through little holes in condoms that only he could see, must be turning in his grave. Benedict sidelined Trujillo when he became pope, so perhaps he always had doubts about the Colombian\'s credibility.The church\'s position on sex has long contained doses of hypocrisy. Even in times of mass religious observance, it has been well aware that its rules have been flouted or ignored. You can dress it up as the dictates of conscience, or pragmatism, or even human sinfulness, but women have always attempted to practise birth control or, if that failed, risked abortions.A recent US survey found 40% of women seeking abortions were Catholic (and a further 40% belonged to other religious groups) â€“ proportions that have probably scarcely altered, despite all the condemnation, since the mid-19th century, when one in six pregnancies in the US are thought to have been aborted. Even the rhythm method, or natural family planning as the church calls it, is a form of birth control, in that it attempts to avoid procreation.Perhaps lapsed Catholics like me should welcome the pope\'s shuffle. At least it starts to undermine one of the Vatican\'s least intellectually coherent positions: the thin end of a very long wedge. If this can change, what else might follow, if not under this ageing pontiff then his successor? We already have some married priests, converted from Anglicanism. What if the next pope, in response to a divine revelation to answer the shortage of vocations, decided that women could be ordained too? Where would Church of England refugees be then?',
